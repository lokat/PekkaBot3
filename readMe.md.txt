# Create your own Discord Bot Tutorial.

Step 1. Create your own discord bot. [Instructions](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).

Step 2. Open src/Commands/Constants.

Step 3. Input your key you got from Step 2 in the "".

#### Warning! The next few steps require coding knowledge. If you do not understand this you can PM pekkapost for help. The core idea here is trying to compress all the code into a runable jar file. IntelliJ is not required but a program that can do this is however.

Step 4. Using [IntelliJ Idea Project](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows), go to File -> Project Structure -> Artifacts. Create a jar that should look something like [this](https://imgur.com/hch2mSu). (PekkaBot 2/3 are interchangable)

Step 5. Then go to Build -> Build Artifacts and run the artifact you just created.

#### Congrats! You have finished the coding segment. All thats left is to run your newly created bot!

Step 6. You now have a runable jar in out/artifacts/PekkaBot3_jar/.

Step 7. Open command promt there and run `java -jar PekkaBot3.jar`.

###### If step 4 and 5 are too confusing I can build it for you instead. Just send me the key you created and I will make the jar for you.
